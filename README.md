# BlockInfo/MScProject

This repository contains code for the project submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Masters of Digital Currency degree at the University of Nicosia, School of Business, Nicosia, Cyprus.

This project aims to implement a decentralized application for conducting electronic draws and lotteries. My approach is to build a service which can ensure decentralization, security, transparency and verifiability. For this purpose my application is using the hash values of Bitcoin blocks as source of randomness in order to capture the high needed entropy and moreover the application is taking advantage of the OP_RETURN transaction for storing successfully the results of the draw-lottery to the blockchain. 

The steps towards building the application as well as the experimental tests implemented for securing the functionality of the algorithm will be available in the near future after the presentation of my project.
